Sharing my most-used macOS and iOS Shortcuts for the benefit of others.

## [Things 3](things_3)

* **Create GTD Weekly Review:** creates a new project for GTD weekly review. Adjust the included dictionary to customize to-dos to match your review style / needs
* **Someday Projects Hygiene:** for each Project with Start = Someday, loops thru child to-dos to set their Start = Someday as well
