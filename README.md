Sharing my most-used macOS and iOS Shortcuts for the benefit of others.

Instructions for importing these are described on the [Apple Support site](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts-mac/apd02bffbaac/mac).

## [Things 3](things_3)

* **Create GTD Weekly Review:** creates a new project for GTD weekly review. Adjust the included dictionary to customize to-dos to match your review style / needs
* **Someday Projects Hygiene:** for each Project with Start = Someday, loops thru child to-dos to set their Start = Someday as well
