# shortcuts

Sharing my most-used macOS and iOS shortcuts for the benefit of others.

Instructions for importing these are described on the [Apple Support site](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/shortcuts-mac/apd02bffbaac/mac).

## [Bear](bear)

### Create Meeting Notes ###

Creates a brand-new Bear note, pre-populated with sections to capture meeting attendees & minutes, then "pre-file" them into a customer-specific tag under #Work/Meetings.

## [Day One](day_one)

### Add to Daily Note ###

Appends user input to a daily note within Day One (or creates the note if it doesnâ€™t already exist for the current date).  This is configured to be pinned to the Menu Bar, which allows you to run it by navigating to menu bar > Shortcuts > Add to Daily Note

## Import PDFs into Day One ##

For the folder selected at runtime, extracts the text from any PDF file and creates separate Day One entries in the journal named "Journal" (edit the shortcut to pick an alternative destination).  Creation date of the PDF file is used as the Day One entry date.  Each new Day One entry is tagged with "Import".

## [Safari](safari)

### Avert Paywall ###

Takes any URL (including those not already open in Safari) and processes them thru [archive.today](https://archive.today), which bypasses nearly all paywalls.

## [Things 3](things_3)

### Create GTD Weekly Review

Creates a new project for GTD weekly review. Adjust the included dictionary to customize to-dos to match your review style / needs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This shortcut assumes you have an existing area named "Weekly Routines" to hold the project.  If not, edit the shortcut to reference a different Area (or none at all).

Example output after running the shortcut:

### Someday Projects Hygiene

For each Project with Start = Someday, loops thru child to-dos to set their Start = Someday as well
